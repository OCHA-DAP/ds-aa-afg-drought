This repo contains analysis/exploratory analysis of climatic variables in Afghanistan related to potential AA activities.

## Background Info

22 April 2024, work began with the objective of exploring potential ways to monitor drought in Afghanistan in the context of Anticipatory Action (AA) activities.

As of now, the only  the visuals/analysis that has been shared or discussed with partners are the quarto documents in the exploration folder.

Quarto outputs for sharing will be linked as the one below:

[1. Exploratory - Exploration of Climate indicators ](https://rpubs.com/zackarno/1176973)

[2. Exploratory - Prioritization support (rainfall + IPC) ](https://rpubs.com/zackarno/1200340)
